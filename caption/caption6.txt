In 2020, we started wearing masks as we witnessed a once-in-a-century pandemic unfold around the world. What saddened me the most was that you, my dear, were only five years old and had to wear a mask for three consecutive years—something unfair for children like you. Thankfully, we now have advanced medical technology that allows humanity to face and recover from challenges posed by nature’s diseases. Compared to the devastation caused by diseases like smallpox in the past, we are indeed fortunate. Even with your mask on, you were so full of joy. I hope that in your life, no matter how dark it gets, there will always be a ray of light to shine on you and bring you brightness.

In 2022, we returned to Chongqing for the first time during the pandemic and experienced inbound quarantine for the first time. Looking at the deserted airport, itâ€™s something we might never witness again in our lifetime. The three years of the pandemic turned Hong Kong and the mainland into two isolated islands. But everything will eventually pass. Perhaps one day, you can share your experiences during these three years as historical stories with your children. Regardless, we made it through. I hope you face the world with optimism. There will likely be many lows in your future, but I hope you confront them with your head held high, not with the dejected posture seen in this photo. Let this picture serve as a reminder of what not to do.

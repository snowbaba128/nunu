During Christmas 2024, we went skiing in Canada. You were still learning how to carve, so we practiced on the magic carpet first. After mastering it, we started with the green runs, and by the time we left, you were confidently skiing on blue runs. I’m so proud of you! Of course, there was a moment when you fell because you were going too fast—it hurt, and you cried so much, even saying you never wanted to ski again. But in the end, you pushed through, came back the next day, and kept practicing until you mastered this skill. This shows that no matter what challenges or obstacles you face, as long as you don’t give up easily, you will eventually succeed. Keep going, my dear!

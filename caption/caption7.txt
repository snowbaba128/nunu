In 2021, you tried being a goalie for the first time, and you looked so cool. I hope you always stay open-minded and curious about everything. Many things are worth tryingâ€”be brave and explore as many different things as you can. Even if you end up not liking something, the purpose of trying is to help you develop a more open attitude toward the unknown. When you no longer fear the unknown, it will be easier for you to make the right choices. Keep it up!

In 2018, when you were not even three and a half years old, you learned how to ride a bike without training wheels. Do you remember practicing under our building at Sorrento? I held the bike from behind, encouraging you to keep pedaling. When you succeeded, you shouted, ‘Daddy, I did it!’ I hope that in the future, whenever you face challenges, you’ll think of your three-year-old self and remind yourself that with effort, you can achieve anything. And when you do, I hope you’ll still come to me and say, ‘Daddy, I did it.’

In 2023, while biking downhill from the Alps in Europe, you fell on a gravel path and badly scraped your hand. Small stones got embedded in your skin and needed immediate disinfection and treatment. Do you remember how Daddy took you to find a clinic at the foot of the mountain? We eventually found a clinic that was about to close, but since we didn’t have local currency and they didn’t accept credit cards, we had to pay twice the price in U.S. dollars to buy the medicine. When the off-duty doctor saw how much we had paid, they stayed back to help treat your wound. Seeing your pitiful little face, Daddy’s heart didn’t rest easy until your injury was taken care of.
